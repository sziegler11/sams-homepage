Exchanges allow users to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency's such as Bitcoin and trade among these currencies. However, such entities easily become targets for hackers; due to the irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions, if a hacker is able to gain access to a hot wallet storing a lot of funds, these funds can be quickly and permanently compromised. Beyond the private keys themselves, these exchanges also generally require private information such as phone numbers, physical addresses, email addresses etc., which themselves serve to associate your identity with possession of cryptocurrency.

In this post, we'll look at Bisq, and how it enables the purchasing, selling, and trading of Bitcoin in a more private and secure way than a centralized exchange.
