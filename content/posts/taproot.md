In November 2021, at block height 709,632, the Taproot upgrade became active on the Bitcoin network. More specifically, this means that this block was the first for which Bitcoin nodes started enforcing the rules of Taproot. But what is Taproot, and how did it come to be deployed?

There are really a few innovations bundled under the umbrella of “Taproot.” These include:

* Schnorr signatures (BIP-340)
* Taproot outputs (BIP-341)
* Tapscript (BIP-342)
